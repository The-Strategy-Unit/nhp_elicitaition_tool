Rate_{(y,i)}=
\cfrac{
  \sum_{(a,s)}{
    \cfrac{
      n_{(a,s,y,i)}
    }{
      d_{(a,s,y,i)}
    }
    \cdot
    p_{(a,s,y=2019)}
  }
}{
  \sum_{(a,s)}{p_{(a,s,y=2019)}}
}
$$


where

* $a$ is age
* $s$ is sex
* $y$ is year
* $i$ is the current strategy
* $n_{(a,s,y,i)}$ is the amount of activity for strategy $i$ in year $y$, for each age and sex
* $d_{(a,s,y,i)}$ is the denominator for strategy $i$ in year $y$, for each age and sex
* $p_{(a,s,y=2019)}$ is the standard population in year 2019, for each age and sex

For Rates per N population, $n$ is the count of admissions for that strategy in that year, and $d$ is the count of all admissions in that year

For Mean Length of Stay, $n$ is the sum of length of stay (`SPELDUR`) for that strategy in that year, and $d$ is the count of admissioins for that stategy in that year.

The standard population used is the total admissions in 2019/20, rather than the whole population estimate.
