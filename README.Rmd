<!-- badges: end -->

Shiny app for the NHP National Elicitation Project.

## Deployment

The script `deploy.R` can be used to redeploy to the production and development environments.

The app is controlled by some environment variables that need to be set:

- `PHASE_1_END` should be the time and date when the first phase should end (in the form `YYYY-mm-dd HH:MM:SS` for the timezone `Europe/London`)
- `PHASE_2_END` should be as `PHASE_1_END`, but the time and date for when the second phase should end
- `PHASE_2_LIVE` should be set to a non-empty string to enable the second phase of the app: this allows the app to enter a "disabled" state at the end of phase 1
- `NHP_SALT` is a value that is used when encrypting the emails of users
- `save_path` should point to the location where to save the database to. If not set, then it defaults to the current working directory

## Development usage

The data required to run the app can be rebuilt using `targets::tar_make()`. There are a few things that need to be set
up in order to get this to work.

1) you will need to create a `.Renviron` file, with the following items:

  - DB_SERVER=...
  - DB_DATABASE=...
  - NHP_SALT=...

2) you will need to be connected to the MLCSU VPN and have access to the database.

3) you will need a copy of the file `recruitment.xlsx`, stored in the root of the project folder.
