Shiny app for the NHP National Elicitation Project.

## Development usage

The data required to run the app can be rebuilt using `targets::tar_make()`. There are a few things that need to be set
up in order to get this to work.

1) you will need to create a `.Renviron` file, with the following items:

  - DB_SERVER=...
  - DB_DATABASE=...
  - NHP_SALT=...

2) you will need to be connected to the MLCSU VPN and have access to the database.

3) you will need a copy of the file `recruitment.xlsx`, stored in the root of the project folder.
