Some falls that result in an emergency admission to hospital are potentially avoidable if the appropriate preventative services are in place. A range of evidence based services and interventions exist that can reduce falls in the elderly. Implementation across the country is variable and as such there remains significant scope to reduce the incidence of falls further. Examples of preventative services include home risk assessments for trip hazards, strength and balance training for those at risk and fall telemonitoring.

Falls related admissions are identified in the tool in a number of ways:

* spells where there is a falls related ICD10 cause code and a traumatic injury (explicit),
* spells where the primary diagnosis is R296 (Tendancy to fall)
* spells where there is no external cause ICD10 code but there is a diagnosis of one of a number of fractures that are commonly associated with a fall such as a fractured wrist

Within the tool the three sets of admissions are grouped, in this case, into a single factor.
