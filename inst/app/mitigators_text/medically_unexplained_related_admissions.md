Around 1 in 4 people who visit their GP have symtoms that the GP is unable to explain [even after conducting appropriate testing][1]. Sometimes the symptoms are severe enough to precipitate an admission to hospital yet ultimately an underlying physical cause cannot be determined.

Some of these symptoms may have a psychological cause and as such may be avoidable through improved access to psychological therapy services or through population health measures that promote psychological well being.
