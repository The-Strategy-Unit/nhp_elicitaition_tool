Around 1 in 4 people who visit their GP have symtoms that the GP is unable to explain [even after conducting appropriate testing][1]. Sometimes the symptoms are severe enough to precipitate an admission to hospital yet ultimately an underlying physical cause cannot be determined.

Some of these symptoms may have a psychological cause and as such may be avoidable through improved access to psychological therapy services or through population health measures that promote psychological well being. 

The tool identifies admissions where the primary diagnosis is one of a small basket (listed below) of symptoms where a physiological cause is in many cases undetectable.
