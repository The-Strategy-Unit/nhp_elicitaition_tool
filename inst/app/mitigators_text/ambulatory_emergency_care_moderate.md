The underlying principle of Ambulatory Emergency Care (AEC) is that a significant proportion of adult patients requiring emergency care can be managed safely and appropriately on the same day, either without admission to a hospital bed at all, or admission for only a number of hours. Further information about AEC can be found on the Ambulatory Emergency Care Network website.

The Ambulatory Emergency care Network has developed a directory of ambulatory emergency care for adults which identifies 58 emergency conditions that have the potential to be managed on an ambulatory basis i.e. As an emergency day case. The directory provides, for each condition, an indicative assumption about the proportion of admissions that could be managed on an ambulatory basis.


The tool groups these individual conditions into four categories:

Those that the directory suggests have a low potential to be managed on an ambulatory basis (10-30% of cases)
Those that the directory suggest have a moderate potential to be managed on an ambulatory basis (30-60% of cases)
Those that the directory suggest have a high potential to be managed on an ambulatory basis (60-90% of cases)
Those that the directory suggest have a very high potential to be managed on an ambulatory basis (90-100% of cases)


The HRG and diagnosis codes used within the coding of this factor can be found within the latest (6th) edition of the [Directory of ambulatory emergency care].
