Day surgery is now established practice with rates continuing to increase. Due to advances in anaesthesia and surgical techniques, it is the standard pathway of care for many complex patients and procedures traditionally treated through inpatient pathways.

Day surgery represents high-quality patient care with excellent patient satisfaction. Shorter hospital stays and early mobilization reduce rates of hospital-acquired infection and venous thromboembolism. Patients overwhelmingly endorse day surgery, with smaller waiting times, less risk of cancellation, lower rates of infection, and the preference of their own surroundings to convalesce. 

The British Association of Day Surgery (BADS) produce a Directory of Procedures which identifes surgical interventions that can be delivered in a day case or outpatient setting  instead of an elective ordinary inpatient setting which often results in an  overnight stay. For each procedure the directory provides an indication of the percentage of spells that could be carried out in each setting.

The tool identifies spells where the procedures are recommended by BADS to occasionally be performed in a daycase setting (5 to 33% of these procedures).
