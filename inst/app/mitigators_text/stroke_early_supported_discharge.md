Early supported discharge is an intervention for adults after a stroke that allows their care to be transferred from an inpatient environment to a community setting. It enables people to continue their rehabilitation therapy at home, with the same intensity and expertise that they would receive in hospital. 

The tool identifies patients who have a stroke related HRG code who may benefit from a reduced inpatient LOS through supported discharge.
