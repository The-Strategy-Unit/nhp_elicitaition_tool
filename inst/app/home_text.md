**Please read carefully before starting this exercise.**

You are required to provide forecast intervals for the **percentage reduction** in certain types of hospital activity at the England level over a twenty-year time horizon.
The focus here is exclusively on hospital activity which may be **mitigated**.
_You must not incorporate factors which increase hospital activity into your judgements because such factors are accommodated elsewhere in the model._

In total there are 77 parameters to forecast.
The app will only offer you those parameters which you opted to select in the consent form (if you selected all options then you will have 77 parameters to forecast).
All the parameters are presented at the England level.

**The app will automatically close on Tue 17 Oct 2023 (midnight).**
**Please try and complete your assignment before then.**
**If you do not complete all the assignment, we will still endeavour to use what we can.**

For each parameter

1) There is a descriptive text box that provides an outline of why reducing the type of activity is desired along with some information about how the type of activity is identified

2) There is a plot of historical trends across England.
These plots show data based on routinely collected Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data.
The trends are provided for information only.

    **Please pay close attention to the vertical axis on each chart as this will tell you the type of change you are forecasting, in many cases it will be the rate of admissions or attendances, but some parameters require different assumptions, for example, about how length of stay might reduce or how the proportion of cases that are undertaken in a particular setting might reduce.**  <br />

    In some instances, the plots may show an unusual change or pattern.
This is likely to reflect data quality issues and/or a change in the clinical coding process.
Please discount these unusual patterns.

#### Your task

1) To review the description and plot for each parameter.
If you see an unusual pattern on the timeseries plots, please ignore these patterns as they are most likely to be data/coding issues.

2) To thoughtfully list out the factors which you think will lead to a surprising (low or high) value.
We want realistic, plausible, surprising values.
We don't want unrealistic, implausible, extremely surprising values.

    In listing factors which might mitigate certain types of hospital activity we want you to consider those things that could be done to prevent, reduce or divert (away from the hospital) such activity.
In general, such factors will relate to enhanced provision of primary and community care, novel models of care, changes to existing services or public health interventions.
The impact of the population ageing and healthy life expectancy are accommodated elsewhere in the model and so should not be incorporated in your judgments.

    For example, in 2019, about 4 out of 100 hospital admissions were falls related admissions.
You might consider that these could be reduced by factors such as enhanced falls prevention services in the community, increased provision of home care, increased provision of telehealth monitoring, public health campaigns and social prescribing.
The impact of the population ageing and healthy life expectancy should not be considered.
You should not modify your prediction about falls admissions on the basis that there will be more older people in the population because this is accommodated elsewhere in the model.

3) Use the slider to select the lower and upper % values for your forecast based on the factors you have listed.
The percentage reductions can only go from 0% (no reduction) to 100% (total reduction).

4) Please note you cannot skip a parameter.
If you are completely uncertain, then this is best recorded as a 0% to 100% interval which is the maximum level of uncertainty with supporting text to justify this.

5) Upon completion you will see the final "completed" screen.

6) Your work is automatically saved and the app will remember your progress.
