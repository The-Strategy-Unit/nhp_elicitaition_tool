Thank you for taking the time and effort to participate in Round One. 
Your contribution is very important and much appreciated. 

In Round Two, which is the final stage, you will see how your original judgements compare with those of your peers.
The purpose of Round Two is to provide you with further data for you to thoughtfully reflect upon before deciding your final forecast.

Please read the instructions below carefully.

It is essential to complete Round Two for your judgements to be used by the research team.

#### Your Task

1) Review your original forecast. 

    * There is now an additional chart which shows your forecast (as a blue line) compared to every other forecast.
    * Please consider how your forecast interval and the factors you have listed, compares with those your peers.  To view the comments, hover your cursor over the end points of the lines. You may find it useful to use a large display screen if the text appears too small on a mobile device.
    * If you do edit your forecast, you will see a vertical yellow band change as you adjust your forecast. This allows you to see how your revised forecast compares with the forecasts of your peers whilst keeping your original forecast (blue line) visible.

    Data quality matters

    * Please provide a clear rationale for low and high values. The rationale will be very important to end users and future researchers. Please discount ageing population as this is covered elsewhere in the model.
    * Please note that all parameters that are set at 0% to 100% will be excluded in the final analysis because this is the least informative of forecasts and cannot reliably be distinguished from the default set by the software in round 1. Values >0% and <100% will be included.
    * Please explain any uncommon abbreviations.

2) Please complete all the parameters assigned. 

Upon completion you will see the final "completed" screen. Unfortunately, any parameters which are not completed before the deadline, cannot be used by the research team.

If you have any queries, please email [strategy.unit@nhs.net](mailto:strategy.unit@nhs.net).

Thank you again for your participation in this important exercise.
